1. - Insight: The are two market patterns in the metropolitan, Southerrn $ Eastern Metropolitan are the luxury market with offering high-end properties. Northern is the densely most populated area in metropolitan with lot of sales at mid range prices (indicates stability of  demand & supply). In outside Metropolitan city, Northern & Western Victoria are the most affordable prices.
   - Recommendations:
     - Marketing : Use Premimium ads for Southern & Eastern metropolitan to reach the target audiens. Focus on marketing "Best Value" for Northern metropolitan/victoria to maintain voulme of sales.
     - Investing : The property market in the Southern & Eastern metropolitan offers higher risk, but also higher potential return/profit. On the other hand, Northern & Western Victoria offers stable returns and lower risks.
2. - Insight: The Graph shows that sales slow down in March - April (Autumn season) adn reach the lowest point in July. The market began to rise significantly in July- August (Late winter/early spring)
   - Recommendations:
      - Sellers : The best time to market a property to get the optimal prices is on July -  early August.
      - Agents : Prepare a massive marketing campaign at the end of winter (July-August) to take advantage of the spring surge (August-September).
3. - Insight: In general, the farther away from the city, the cheaper the property prices tends to be. But in Melbourne, the looation region of the property is more important. A house located 10KM away in Western metropolitan (Cheaper area) can be much more affordable than a house located 10KM away in Northern metropolitan (luxurious area). Each region its on pricing pattern based on the distance.
   - Recommendations: To agents, change the strategic to sales property  with  sells the value of the region (facilities, prestige, lifestyle), not just focus on distance of the property where the nearest of the city.
